# Basic Study Timer/Stopwatch Website

While studying in college I couldn't find a stopwatch website that fit my exact needs. A lot them had ads and were honestly too complex. So I took it into my own hands to try to build a website with help from this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIiMSMz7KzM&t=1264s

It remains largely unfinished as I ran into issues, I beleiev with the hosting, that I couldn't figure out. This is something I hope to return to and get a working copy!
